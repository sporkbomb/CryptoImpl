This is a long-term project in which I implement various crypto functions.
They're in Haskell, which is somewhat close to pseudocode, and should be well documented enough so you can follow what the code is doing.
It's all under a simplified BSD license, so if you want, feel free to copy and use it. However, heed the warnings in the source.
Most coders don't know their crypto, and while I'm trying to change that, I also don't.

Improvements/suggestions/requests? Mail sporkbomb-crypto at acanthephyra[.]net.
